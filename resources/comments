> Simpler alternative design

1> Same as TicTacToe approach rather having pieces location info
board can store the location of pieces :

board[0][0] = new Rook(WHITE); board[7][7] = new Rook(BLACK);

and while making the moves,

Piece tem = board[0][0];
board[0][3] = tem;
board[0][0] = null;

2> No need to Move class as position details are embedded in the board

3> Piece class will be simplified with just Color and validateMove()

public abstract class Piece {
    protected final Color color;

    protected Piece(Color color, int row, int col) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public abstract boolean isValidMove(int curRow, int curCol, int nxtRow, int nxtCol);
}
